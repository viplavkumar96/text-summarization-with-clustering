2,"Machine learning (ML) is the scientific study of algorithms and statistical models that computer systems use to effectively perform a specific task without using explicit instructions, relying on patterns and inference instead.  It is seen as a subset of artificial intelligence.  Machine learning algorithms build a mathematical model of sample data, known as  training data , in order to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to perform the task. Machine learning algorithms are used in the applications of email filtering, detection of network intruders, and computer vision, where it is infeasible to develop an algorithm of specific instructions for performing the task.  Machine learning is closely related to computational statistics, which focuses on making predictions using computers.  The study of mathematical optimization delivers methods, theory and application domains to the field of machine learning.  Data mining is a field of study within machine learning, and focuses on exploratory data analysis through unsupervised learning. In its application across business problems, machine learning is also referred to as predictive analytics. ",https://en. wikipedia. org/wiki/Machine_learning,Machine Learning

It was born from pattern recognition and the theory that computers can learn without being programmed to perform specific tasks; researchers interested in artificial intelligence wanted to see if computers could learn from data.

6,"In computer science, artificial intelligence (AI), sometimes called machine intelligence, is intelligence demonstrated by machines, in contrast to the natural intelligence displayed by humans and other animals.  Computer science defines AI research as the study of  intelligent agents : any device that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of successfully achieving its goals.  More specifically, Kaplan and Haenlein define AI as “a system’s ability to correctly interpret external data, to learn from such data, and to use those learnings to achieve specific goals and tasks through flexible adaptation”.  Colloquially, the term  artificial intelligence  is used to describe machines that mimic  cognitive  functions that humans associate with other human minds, such as  learning  and  problem solving .  As machines become increasingly capable, tasks considered to require  intelligence  are often removed from the definition of AI, a phenomenon known as the AI effect.  A quip in Tesler's Theorem says  AI is whatever hasn't been done yet.   For instance, optical character recognition is frequently excluded from things considered to be AI, having become a routine technology.  Modern machine capabilities generally classified as AI include successfully understanding human speech, competing at the highest level in strategic game systems (such as chess and Go), autonomously operating cars, and intelligent routing in content delivery networks and military simulations.

7,"Artificial intelligence is a branch of computer science that aims to create intelligent machines.  It has become an essential part of the technology industry.  Knowledge engineering is a core part of AI research.  Machines can often act and react like humans only if they have abundant information relating to the world.  Artificial intelligence must have access to objects, categories, properties and relations between all of them to implement knowledge engineering.  Initiating common sense, reasoning and problem-solving power in machines is a difficult and tedious task. Machine learning is also a core part of AI.  Learning without any kind of supervision requires an ability to identify patterns in streams of inputs, whereas learning with adequate supervision involves classification and numerical regressions.  Classification determines the category an object belongs to and regression deals with obtaining a set of numerical input or output examples, thereby discovering functions enabling the generation of suitable outputs from respective inputs.  Mathematical analysis of machine learning algorithms and their performance is a well-defined branch of theoretical computer science often referred to as computational learning theory.

8,"Artificial intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems.  These processes include learning (the acquisition of information and rules for using the information), reasoning (using rules to reach approximate or definite conclusions) and self-correction.  Particular applications of AI include expert systems, speech recognition and machine vision.  AI can be categorized as either weak or strong.  Weak AI, also known as narrow AI, is an AI system that is designed and trained for a particular task.  Virtual personal assistants, such as Apple's Siri, are a form of weak AI.  Strong AI, also known as artificial general intelligence, is an AI system with generalized human cognitive abilities.

The term is frequently applied to the project of developing systems endowed with the intellectual processes characteristic of humans, such as the ability to reason, discover meaning, generalize, or learn from past experience.  Since the development of the digital computer in the 1940s, it has been demonstrated that computers can be programmed to carry out very complex tasks—as, for example, discovering proofs for mathematical theorems or playing chess—with great proficiency.  Still, despite continuing advances in computer processing speed and memory capacity, there are as yet no programs that can match human flexibility over wider domains or in tasks requiring much everyday knowledge.  On the other hand, some programs have attained the performance levels of human experts and professionals in performing certain specific tasks, so that artificial intelligence in this limited sense is found in applications as diverse as medical diagnosis, computer search engines, and voice or handwriting recognition.

16,"A blockchain, originally block chain,is a growing list of records, called blocks, which are linked using cryptography. Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block,a timestamp, and transaction data (generally represented as a merkle tree root hash).  By design, a blockchain is resistant to modification of the data.  It is  an open, distributed ledger that can record transactions between two parties efficiently and in a verifiable and permanent way . For use as a distributed ledger, a blockchain is typically managed by a peer-to-peer network collectively adhering to a protocol for inter-node communication and validating new blocks.  Once recorded, the data in any given block cannot be altered retroactively without alteration of all subsequent blocks, which requires consensus of the network majority.  Although blockchain records are not unalterable, blockchains may be considered secure by design and exemplify a distributed computing system with high Byzantine fault tolerance.  Decentralized consensus has therefore been claimed with a blockchain. ",https://en. wikipedia. org/wiki/Blockchain,Blockchain
